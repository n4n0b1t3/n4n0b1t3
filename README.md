I had a lot of fun during the dot-com era. What I did back then would be called full stack lamp development today. As the development resources became more specialised, my core tasks became more related to my organisational talent.  
For the last 13 years I have worked in interface positions between agile software development and waterfall-driven management as a project manager. My current field of work is requirements engineering.
My goal is to get deeper into development in the Web3 environment. That is why I am very interested in DAPPs and new forms of organisation, the DAOs. I am open for new projects.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a small Web3 project where the skills needed are more one entry level.
- ðŸ¤” I would like to exchange ideas with people who, like me, are in the middle of life, have a permanent job and would also like to develop their skills in the Web3 environment to such an extent that a move to a new position with a comparable salary level becomes possible.
